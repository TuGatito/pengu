# Pengu

Pengu is a programming language that compiles to CPP and aims to be fresh, easy to read and fun that even my baby Pengu can write code in Pengu.

## About

Pengu is a fun language that can be written as easily as Moonscript (a language like Python) but with the brute force of Cpp.

It is inspired by several languages: Moonscript in the general syntax and indentation part, Kotlin for the new features like string templates and static typing style, Rust in the way of handling, displaying and helping with errors.

The best way to see this language is as a normal and healthy human alternative to Cpp and Rust languages.

Note: This language does not pretend to be faster than Cpp or a better alternative, since my skills are very, very far from achieving something like that.

Note 2: I know this language is not for everyone -especially for purists- but, I know I'm not the only one -if I am, no problem- who wants a language that allows him to use Cpp without feeling like he's using Cpp haha.

## The Why

Why the need to make a new language and compile it to Cpp?

Short answer: I've always wanted to do it and it may be a skill issue but, for me, life is too short to write Cpp.

Long answer: It all started because I wanted to make games and GUI applications using Cpp. But, the problem is that it takes me a long time to write code in Cpp and, if for example, it takes me 2 days to make a feature in Cpp, in Python or Kotlin I could already have the app done.

Why don't you use Python or Kotlin to compensate for your skill issue?

Well, it's not that simple since, from my point of view, they have a big negative point. In the case of Kotlin you have to have the JVM installed and there are no libraries available that I need. In the case of Python, even though recent versions like 3.12 already have a kind of static typing, I find it strange as it doesn't fit at all, apart from the fact that portability is complicated (Android, iOS, Web, etc.).

This is where my idea comes from, what if there is a language with the advantages of Cpp but with the modern syntax of Kotlin and Moonscript (an indentation language similar to Python but I like its syntax better hehe) ?

Thus, it would be a language that is easy to read, fast to write, and with the brute force of Cpp.

Oh, and the name comes from my baby since that is his nickname since it reminds me of the penguin from "El Pajaro Loco" (Woody Woodpecker).

## Todo List

After completing the ordered list, I will do the other tasks as I need them and whatever is easiest for me haha.

1. [ ] Define the syntax of the language.
2. [ ] Create the parser with Lark.
3. [ ] Create a Rust-style code evaluator.
4. [ ] Create a Pengu to Cpp code translator.

- [ ] Create a beautiful and easy to use CLI.
- [ ] Create the standard library.
- [ ] Create a package by extending the CLI.
- [ ] Create a project manager by extending the CLI.
- [ ] Create an IDE for the language.
- [ ] Create an LSP for the language IDE.
- [ ] Make the compiler able to make libraries.
- [ ] Make the compiler able to translate Cpp code to Pengu.
- [ ] Move the project code from Python to Pengu, to try to be faster and self-compiled.
